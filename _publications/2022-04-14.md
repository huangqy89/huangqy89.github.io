excerpt: "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) helps disaggregate a household’s main electricity consumption to energy usages of individual appliances, greatly cutting down the cost of fine-grained load monitoring towards the green home vision. To address the privacy concern in NILM applications, federated learning (FL) could be leveraged for NILM model training and sharing. When applying the FL paradigm in real-world NILM applications, however, we are faced with the challenges of edge resource restriction, edge model personalization, and edge training data scarcity. We present FedNILM, a practical FL paradigm for NILM applications at the edge client. Specifically, FedNILM delivers privacy-preserving and personalized NILM services to large-scale edge clients, by leveraging i) collaborative data aggregation through federated learning, ii) efficient cloud model compression via filter pruning and multi-task learning …"
