excerpt: "Due to the benefits of small latency, low energy consumption and increased data rate, device-to-device (D2D) communication is recognized as one of the promising techniques in the 5G era. However, the distributed nature of D2D communication makes it non-trivial to generate symmetric keys for the involving parties. Many efforts have been devoted to dynamically generate cryptographic keys for D2D communication in mobile network. However, most of them have limited applicability to practical scenarios due to low key generation efficiency or limited compatibility with commercial mobile devices. In this paper, we design an ambient light based key generation approach, which works on commercial off-the-shelf mobile devices, and achieves high key generation efficiency. We observe that mobile devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets) are often equipped with ambient light sensors and devices sense different light …"
