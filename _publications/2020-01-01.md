excerpt: "In recent years,smart speakers and robotic vacuum cleaners have played important roles in
many people's daily life．With the development in technology, more and more intelligent devices will
become parts of home infrastructure, making life more convenient and comfortable for residents．
When different types of specialized intelligent devices are connected and operated over the Internet,
how to minimize network latency and guarantee data privacy are open issues．In order to solve these
problems, edge computing in smart homes becomes the future trend．In this article, wep resent our
research work along this direction, covering the topics on edge sensing, communication and
computation．As for sensing, we focus on the pervasive sensing capability of the edge node and present our work on contactless breath monitoring; as for communication, we work on the joint design of sensing and communication, so that sensing and communication systems can work harmoniously on
limited spectrum resources; as for computation, we devote our efforts to personalized machine
learning at the edge, building personalized model for each individual while guaranteeing their data
privacy．"
