excerpt: "Network performance monitoring and troubleshooting is a crucial but challenging task in datacenter management. Despite the numerous solutions that have been proposed in recent years, their efforts are often hindered by high costs and unreliable fault localization, making it difficult to deploy them in real-world environments. In this paper, we present LMon, a highly reliable and efficient system for monitoring and troubleshooting in datacenter networks. LMon utilizes the characteristic of ECMP hashing linearity to control the packet routing without any modification of the underlying protocols. Additionally, LMon leverages a lightweight probing technique to reduce monitoring overhead. Furthermore, the system integrates improved LASSO regression and statistical hypothesis testing for higher accuracy and faster processing in link failure localization. The effectiveness of LMon is demonstrated through its implementation …"
