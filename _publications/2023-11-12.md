excerpt: "Multi-user indoor localization is considered to be one of the most useful wireless applications. Low latency and high robustness to dynamic interference from surrounding people are essential requirements for multi-user localization. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) indoor localization systems cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time. In this paper, we propose RIScan, a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided localization system that can achieve both low latency and high reliability. We leverage RIS to perform Wi-Fi beam scanning so all clients can figure out their direction in a single scan. However, compared with traditional AP-based systems, the introduction of RIS creates a more complicated signal superposition at the receiver, preventing clients from directly obtaining target beams for direction derivation and localization. To overcome this challenge, we fully utilize the reconfigurability of RIS to …"
