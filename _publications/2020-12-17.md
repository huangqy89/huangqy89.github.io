excerpt: "Accurate device motion tracking enables many applications like Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). To make these applications available in people's daily life, low-cost acoustic-based motion tracking methods are proposed. However, existing acoustic-based methods are all based on distance estimation. These methods measure the distance between a speaker and a microphone. With a speaker or microphone array, it can get multiple estimated distances and further achieve multidimensional motion tracking. The weakness of distance-based motion tracking methods is that they need large array size to get accurate results. Some systems even require an array larger than 1 m. This weakness limits the adoption of existing solutions in a single device like a smart speaker. To solve this problem, we propose Acoustic Strength-based Angle Tracking (ASAT) System and further implement a motion tracking …"
