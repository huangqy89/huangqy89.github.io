excerpt: "Miniature radar has demonstrated its great potential in smart homes, such as understanding the wellness of the residents and providing ubiquitous interactions. While it has many promising applications, it also results in congested RF (radio frequency) environments as there is an unprecedented amount of traffic in a smart home. To ease the strain on the limited spectrum, we ask the question that, can we reuse the sensing signals for data communication? With such a capability, we can improve the spectrum utilization by sharing the spectrum between sensing and communication systems. However, radar signals are customized for the sensing purpose and are incompatible with legacy communication standards. To address this challenge, we have an observation that, non-linearity effect in RF circuits can convert wideband radar signals into a LoRa signal. Based on this observation, in this paper, we present LoRadar …"
