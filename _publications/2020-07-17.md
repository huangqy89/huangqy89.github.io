excerpt: "With the recent advance of technologies, smart homes are no longer just the subjects of science fiction and are now becoming a reality. it is essential for a smart home to understand its residents and provide entertainment and healthcare services. Researchers have demonstrated the great potential of RF sensing in smart homes, including understanding the residents' gesture commands and monitoring the residents' health status unobtrusively. Although RF sensing has appealing properties, it brings congestion to wireless networks. To make the situation worse, there is an unprecedented amount of wireless traffic in smart homes. in this article, we investigate the joint design of sensing and communication systems to alleviate the strain on wireless resources. instead of designing sensing and communication systems as separate objectives, we tend to address them jointly. We discuss this issue from two directions. The …"
