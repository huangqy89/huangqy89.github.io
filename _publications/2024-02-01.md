excerpt: "Federated Learning (FL) has recently received extensive attention in enabling privacy-preserving edge AI services for Human Activity Recognition (HAR). However, users’ mobile and wearable devices in the HAR scenario usually possess dramatically different computing capability and diverse data distributions, making it very challenging for such heterogeneous HAR devices to conduct effective collaborative training (co-training) with the traditional FL schemes. To address this issue, we present Hydra, a Hybrid-model federated learning mechanism that facilitates the co-training among heterogeneous devices by allowing them to train models that well fit their own computing capability. Specifically, Hydra leverages BranchyNet to design a large-small global hybrid-model and enables heterogeneous devices to train the proper parts of the model tailored to their computing capability. Hydra drives co-training among the …"
