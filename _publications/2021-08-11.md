excerpt: "Network measurement provides operators an efficient tool for many network management tasks such as performance diagnosis, traffic engineering and intrusion prevention. However, with the rapid and continuous growth of traffic speed, it needs more computing and memory resources to monitor traffic in per-flow or per-packet granularity. Sample-based measurement systems (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow) have been developed to perform coarse-grained measurement, but they may miss part of records, especially for mice flows, which are important for some network management tasks (e.g., anomaly detection, performance diagnosis). To address these issues, data streaming algorithms such as hash tables and sketches have been introduced to balance the trade-off among accuracy, speed, and memory usage. In this article, we present a systematic survey of various data structures, algorithms and systems which have …"
