title: "CSI-StripeFormer: Exploiting Stripe Features for CSI Compression in Massive MIMO System"
collection: publications
permalink: "/publication/2023-05-17"
excerpt: "The massive MIMO gain for wireless communication has been greatly hindered by the feedback overhead of channel state information (CSI) growing linearly with the number of antennas. Recent efforts leverage the DNN-based encoder-decoder framework to exploit correlations within the CSI matrix for better CSI compression. However, existing works have not fully exploited the unique features of CSI, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance under high compression ratios and sensitivity to multipath effects. Instead of treating CSI as common 2D matrices like images, we reveal the intrinsic stripe-based correlation across the CSI matrix. Driven by this insight, we propose CSI-StripeFormer, a stripe-aware encoder-decoder framework to exploit the unique stripe feature for better CSI compression. We design a lightweight encoder with asymmetric convolution kernels to capture various shape features. We further …"
