excerpt: "Visible light positioning (VLP) is a promising direction for indoor localization. VLP depends on Visible light communication (VLC) to receive location anchors sent by light bulbs. In order to decode high-frequency VLC signals, today's VLP systems require the receiver to equip either rolling shutter cameras or high-frequency light sensors, which bring considerable overhead or are even unavailable on many mobile devices. This paper introduces ALS-P, a lightweight VLP approach which only requires the commercially widely available ambient light sensor (ALS). ALS is conventionally not treated as a feasible VLC receiver as its sampling rate is far less than that of VLC signals. Our basic idea is to leverage the property of frequency aliasing. Through dynamically adjusting the sampling rate of the ALS sensor, the down-converted signals can be uniquely distinguished. To realize this idea, we propose novel designs to …"
