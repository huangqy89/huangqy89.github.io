excerpt: "Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is a well-known single-channel blind source separation problem that aims to decompose the household energy consumption into itemised energy usage of individual appliances. Recent investigations have shown that deep neural networks (DNNs) based approaches are promising for the NILM task. Nevertheless, they normally ignore the inherent properties of appliance operations in the network design, potentially leading to implausible results. We are thus motivated to develop the dual Deep Neural Networks (dual-DNN), which aims to i) take advantage of DNNs’ learning capability of latent features and ii) empower the DNN architecture with identification ability of universal properties. Specifically in the design of dual-DNN, we adopt one subnetwork to measure power ratings of different appliances’ operation states, and the other subnetwork to identify the running states of …"
