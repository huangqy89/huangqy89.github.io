excerpt: "Thanks to the wide bandwidth, large antenna array, and short wavelength, millimeter wave (mmWave) has superior performance in both communication and sensing. Thus, the integration of sensing and communication is a developing trend for the mmWave band. However, the directional transmission characteristics of the mmWave limits the sensing scope to a narrow sector. Existing works coordinate sensing and communication in a time-division manner, which takes advantage of the sector level sweep during the beam training interval for sensing and the data transmission interval for communication. Beam training is a low frequency (e.g., 10Hz) and low duty-cycle event, which makes it hard to track fast movement or perform continuous sensing. Such time-division designs imply that we need to strike a balance between sensing and communication, and it is hard to get the best of both worlds. In this paper, we try to …"
