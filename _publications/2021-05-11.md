excerpt: "With the arrival of the Internet of Things era, IoT devices and the services built on them make our lives more convenient and also raise public concerns on their vulnerability to attacks. Recent literature advocates physical-layer solutions to help IoT devices detect attacks instead of using sophisticated cryptographic methods. However, there is still no satisfying solutions for IoT devices with a single antenna and sparse traffic. Thus, we introduce SecurePilot to fill this gap. SecurePilot is an unsupervised and plug-and-play solution which works without an attacker’s knowledge in advance. It leverages the strengths of two orthogonal physical-layer information, propagation signatures and device signatures embedded in pilot signals to enable effective attack detection. It could work on single-antenna IoT devices with sparse traffic and also work compatibly with communication protocols. The experimental results show that …"
