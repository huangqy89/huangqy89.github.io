excerpt: "The physical and physiological development of infants and toddlers requires the proper amount of macronutrient intake, making it an essential problem to estimate the macronutrient in baby food. Nevertheless, existing solutions are either too expensive or poor performing, preventing the widespread use of automatic baby nutrient intake logging. To narrow this gap, this paper proposes a cost-effective and portable baby food macronutrient estimation system, BabyNutri. BabyNutri exploits a novel spectral reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct high-dimensional informative spectra from low-dimensional spectra, which are available from low-cost spectrometers. We propose a denoising autoencoder for the reconstruction process, by which BabyNutri can reconstruct a 160-dimensional spectrum from a 5-dimensional spectrum. Since the high-dimensional spectrum is rich in light absorption features of macronutrients, it …"
