In this paper, we propose RIScan, a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided localization system that can achieve both low latency and high reliability. We leverage RIS to perform Wi-Fi beam scanning so all clients can figure out their direction in a single scan.

The insurance companies give financial rewards to its policyholders who take the initiative to keep healthy.

However, existing works have not fully exploited the unique features of CSI, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance under high compression ratios and sensitivity to multipath effects. Instead of treating CSI as common 2D matrices like images, we reveal the intrinsic stripe-based correlation across the CSI matrix.

BabyNutri exploits a novel spectral reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct high-dimensional informative spectra from low-dimensional spectra, which are available from low-cost spectrometers.

Existing works coordinate sensing and communication in a time-division manner, which takes advantage of the sector level sweep during the beam training interval for sensing and the data transmission interval for communication. Beam training is a low frequency (e.g., 10Hz) and low duty-cycle event, which makes it hard to track fast movement or perform continuous sensing.

Existing key extraction schemes put the devices into physical proximity and utilize the common inherent randomness between the devices to agree on a secret key, but they often rely on specialized hardware (e.g., the specific wireless NIC model) and have low bit rates. In this article, we seek a key extraction approach that only leverages off-the-shelf mobile devices, while achieving significantly higher key generation efficiency. The core idea of our approach is to exploit the fast varying inaudible acoustic channel as the common random source for key generation and wireless parallel communication for exchanging reconciliation information to improve the key generation rate.

In this paper, we present ShieldScatter, a lightweight system that attaches low-cost tags to single-antenna devices to shield the system from active attacks. The key insight of ShieldScatter is to intentionally create multi-path propagation signatures with the careful deployment of tags.

SecurePilot is an unsupervised and plug-and-play solution which works without an attacker’s knowledge in advance.

NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device’s wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker’s nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively …</p></div><div class="article-action inline-item"><p><a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3117811.3117814"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> Link</a></p><p><a href="/files/2017-10-04.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file" aria-hidden="true"></i> PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class=" list__item publication-item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="/images/publications/2017-06-01.jpg" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title publication-title" itemprop="headline"> Your glasses know your diet: Dietary monitoring using electromyography sensors</h3><p class="author"> <strong>Qianyi Huang</strong>, Wei Wang, Qian Zhang</p><p>Published in <i>IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4 (3), 705-712, 2017</i></p><div class="publication-excerpt"><p>Dietary monitoring can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis, body weight control, and dietary habit management, and thus it is welcomed by patients, dieters, and nutritionists. While various techniques have been used for dietary monitoring in clinical trials and user studies, they are not ready for daily use. Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles. By integrating an electromyography (EMG) sensor into glasses, the glasses can measure the muscle activity of the temporalis to detect intake-related events. This paper instantiates the idea by building a prototype equipped with an EMG sensor, a microcontroller, SD shield/card and a …</p></div><div class="article-action inline-item"><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7828094"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> Link</a></p><p><a href="/files/2017-06-01.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file" aria-hidden="true"></i> PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class=" list__item publication-item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="/images/publications/2016-04-10.jpg" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title publication-title" itemprop="headline"> Battery-free sensing platform for wearable devices: The synergy between two feet</h3><p class="author"> <strong>Qianyi Huang</strong>, Yan Mei, Wei Wang, Qian Zhang</p><p>Published in <i>IEEE INFOCOM 2016-The 35th Annual IEEE International Conference on Computer …, 2016</i></p><div class="publication-excerpt"><p>Recent years have witnessed the prevalence of wearable devices. Wearable devices are intelligent and multifunctional, but they rely heavily on batteries. This greatly limits their application scope, where replacement of battery or recharging is challenging or inconvenient. We note that wearable devices have the opportunity to harvest energy from human motion, as they are worn by the people as long as being functioning. In this study, we propose a battery-free sensing platform for wearable devices in the form-factor of shoes. It harvests the kinetic energy from walking or running to supply devices with power for sensing, processing and wireless communication, covering all the functionalities of commercial wearable devices. We achieve this goal by enabling the whole system running on the harvested energy from two feet. Each foot performs separate tasks and two feet are coordinated by ambient backscatter …</p></div><div class="article-action inline-item"><p><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7524543"><i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> Link</a></p><p><a href="/files/2016-04-10.pdf"><i class="fa fa-file" aria-hidden="true"></i> PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class=" list__item publication-item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="/images/publications/2015-06-25.jpg" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title publication-title" itemprop="headline"> TRADE: A truthful online combinatorial auction for spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks</h3><p class="author"> Lei Zhong, <strong>Qianyi Huang</strong>, Fan Wu, Guihai Chen</p><p>Published in <i>Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing 15 (9), 1320-1330, 2015</i></p><div class="publication-excerpt"><p>Auctions have been shown to be able to tackle the problem of spectrum scarcity effectively, but most of existing works only focus on static scenarios. They cannot deal with the requests of spectrum users as they arrive and leave dynamically. Bidders can either cheat by bidding untruthfully or cheat about the arrival and departure time. In this paper, we model the radio spectrum allocation problem as a sealed‐bid online combinatorial auction and propose a truthful mechanism called TRADE. TRADE is a truthful and an individual rational mechanism with polynomial time complexity. It can prevent bidders from cheating in the auction while achieving good bidder satisfaction, spectrum utilization, and social welfare.

In recent years, a good number of strategy-proof auction mechanisms have been proposed to improve spectrum utilization and to prevent market manipulation. However, the issue of privacy preservation in spectrum auctions remains open. On the one hand, truthful bidding reveals bidders’ private valuations of the spectrum. On the other hand, coverage/interference areas of the bidders may be revealed to determine conflicts. In this paper, we present PISA, which is a PrIvacy preserving and Strategy-proof Auction mechanism for spectrum allocation. PISA provides protection for both bid privacy and coverage/interference area privacy leveraging a privacy-preserving integer comparison protocol, which is well applicable in other contexts.
