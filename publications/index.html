Solutions based on cameras and acoustic signals raise privacy concerns, while WiFi-based solutions are vulnerable to background noise. As a result, these methods are not commercialized and recent flagship smartphones have implemented in-air gesture recognition by adding extra hardware on-board, such as mmWave radar and depth camera.

Commonly-used client selection methods such as partial client selection would lead to the waste of computing resources and weaken the generalization of the global model.

In this paper, we propose a novel Burst Queue Recovery (BQR) model to infer the ABW. BQR first induces an instant network congestion and then observes the one-way delay (OWD) variation until the tight link recovers from the congestion. By correlating the OWDs with the queue length variation, BQR can calculate the ABW accurately. Compared to the traditional probe gap model (PGM) and probe rate model (PRM), our theoretical analysis and simulations show that BQR is more tolerant to the transient traffic burst and supports the scenarios with multiple congestible links.

Dietary information is also a critical dimension for health management but has no convenient solution yet. In this paper, we ask whether we can track meal composition unobtrusively. We introduce Smart-U, a new utensil design that can recognize meal composition during the intake process, without user intervention or on-body instruments. Smart-U makes use of the fact that light spectra reflected by foods are dependent on the food ingredients. By analyzing the reflected light spectra, Smart-U can recognize what food is on top of the utensil. We describe the prototype design of Smart-U and the food recognition algorithm. We demonstrate that Smart-U can recognize 20 types of foods with 93 % accuracy. It can work robustly under different conditions.

This paper discusses a covert channel threat on existing mobile systems. Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device’s wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker’s nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively …</p></p><div class="article-action"><p><a href=" https://yangzhice.com/docforweb/NICScatter/NICScatter_MobiCom.pdf ">PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class=" list__item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> Your glasses know your diet: Dietary monitoring using electromyography sensors52</h3><p class="author"> Q Huang, W Wang, Q ZhangIEEE Internet of Things Journal 4 (3), 705-712, 2017</p><p>Published in <i>IEEE Internet of Things Journal 4 (3), 705-712, 2017</i>, 2017</p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Dietary monitoring can provide valuable information for disease diagnosis, body weight control, and dietary habit management, and thus it is welcomed by patients, dieters, and nutritionists. While various techniques have been used for dietary monitoring in clinical trials and user studies, they are not ready for daily use. Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles. By integrating an electromyography (EMG) sensor into glasses, the glasses can measure the muscle activity of the temporalis to detect intake-related events.

Wearable devices are intelligent and multifunctional, but they rely heavily on batteries. This greatly limits their application scope, where replacement of battery or recharging is challenging or inconvenient. We note that wearable devices have the opportunity to harvest energy from human motion, as they are worn by the people as long as being functioning. In this study, we propose a battery-free sensing platform for wearable devices in the form-factor of shoes. It harvests the kinetic energy from walking or running to supply devices with power for sensing, processing and wireless communication, covering all the functionalities of commercial wearable devices. We achieve this goal by enabling the whole system running on the harvested energy from two feet.

They cannot deal with the requests of spectrum users as they arrive and leave dynamically. Bidders can either cheat by bidding untruthfully or cheat about the arrival and departure time. In this paper, we model the radio spectrum allocation problem as a sealed‐bid online combinatorial auction and propose a truthful mechanism called TRADE. TRADE is a truthful and an individual rational mechanism with polynomial time complexity. It can prevent bidders from cheating in the auction while achieving good bidder satisfaction, spectrum utilization, and social welfare.

In recent years, a good number of strategy-proof auction mechanisms have been proposed to improve spectrum utilization and to prevent market manipulation. However, the issue of privacy preservation in spectrum auctions remains open. On the one hand, truthful bidding reveals bidders’ private valuations of the spectrum. On the other hand, coverage/interference areas of the bidders may be revealed to determine conflicts. In this paper, we present PISA, which is a PrIvacy preserving and Strategy-proof Auction mechanism for spectrum allocation. PISA provides protection for both bid privacy and coverage/interference area privacy leveraging a privacy-preserving integer comparison protocol, which is well applicable in other contexts.
