title: "Integrated Sensing and Communication"
collection: project
permalink: "/project/1"
excerpt: "Radio signals, traditionally used for data communication, are now emerging as sensing media. Researchers have demonstrated the great potential of RF sensing, including understanding gesture commands and monitoring vital signs. However, sensing and communication are contradictory purposes. For the sensing purpose, we use a known sequence to probe unknown channel conditions, while for the communication purpose, we decode unknown messages assuming that the channel conditions are known. We address the challenges encountered when integrating sensing and communication functions and thus they can work in harmony. Accordingly, we build up prototypes to test the performance of our design."
