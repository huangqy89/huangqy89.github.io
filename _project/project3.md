permalink: "/project/3"
excerpt: "Various intelligent devices are connected by wireless links. As wireless signals are broadcast signals, they can be easily eavesdropped by malicious guys. Besides, the miniaturized design paradigm also leave loopholes in the devices. We focus on studying the security issues in IoT devices/IoT networks, and propose corresponding coutermeasures. In addition to the inherent design deficiency, we also investigate the vulnerability in signal processing flows."
