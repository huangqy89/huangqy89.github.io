title: "Intelligent Sensing"
collection: project
permalink: "/project/2"
excerpt: "We investigate how to fully exploit RF signals (Wi-Fi, mmWave, Ultra-wideband), acoustic signals, and visible/invisible light signals to achieve intelligent sensing. We are interested in gesture recognition, motion tracking, food intake logging, and vital sign monitoring, so that we can enable convenient human-computer interactions, location-based services, and long-term health management. We are working toward the vision of smart homes and smart healthcare. We have built several sensing prototypes for various purposes."
