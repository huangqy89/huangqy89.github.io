excerpt: "This course offers an in-depth exploration of computer networks, adopting a top-down approach to present the fundamental concepts and principles. Beginning with application-layer protocols, such as HTTP, FTP, and DNS, the course progressively delves into transport, network, and link-layer mechanisms, including TCP/IP, routing algorithms, and data link technologies. Through this approach, students will gain a holistic understanding of how the Internet functions, from high-level applications to low-level data transmission."
