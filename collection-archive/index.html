In this paper, we model the radio spectrum allocation problem as a sealed‐bid online combinatorial auction and propose a truthful mechanism called TRADE. TRADE is a truthful and an individual rational mechanism with polynomial time complexity. It can prevent bidders from cheating in the auction while achieving good bidder satisfaction, spectrum utilization, and social welfare.

Existing solutions either require tedious manual recording or may impede normal daily activities. In this paper, a pair of diet-aware glasses is designed. The key idea here is that when people wear glasses, the temples of the glasses are in touch with the lower part of the temporalis muscle, one of the mastication muscles.

The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device’s wireless network interface card (NIC).

Smart-U makes use of the fact that light spectra reflected by foods are dependent on the food ingredients. By analyzing the reflected light spectra, Smart-U can recognize what food is on top of the utensil. We describe the prototype design of Smart-U and the food recognition algorithm.

Recent advances have facilitated the communication between backscatter tags and on-body smart devices. These studies have focused on the communication dimension, while the security dimension remains vulnerable. It has been demonstrated that wireless connectivity can be exploited to send unauthorized commands or fake messages that result in device malfunctioning. The key challenge in defending these attacks stems from the minimalist design in backscatter. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of authenticating an on-body backscatter tag without modifying its signal or protocol.

VLP depends on Visible light communication (VLC) to receive location anchors sent by light bulbs. In order to decode high-frequency VLC signals, today’s VLP systems require the receiver to equip either rolling shutter cameras or high-frequency light sensors, which bring considerable overhead or are even unavailable on many mobile devices. This paper introduces ALS-P, a lightweight VLP approach which only requires the commercially widely available ambient light sensor (ALS). ALS is conventionally not treated as a feasible VLC receiver as its sampling rate is far less than that of VLC signals. Our basic idea is to leverage the property of frequency aliasing.

The high probability of tag collision will result in low overall throughput. Although there are some existing efforts to resolve tag collisions, they either require good channel conditions or can only resolve a limited number of tags as channel capacity is deficient when SNR is low. In this article, to overcome this limitation, we bring in antenna arrays to boost the channel capacity. We propose FreeScatter, which can support scalable concurrent backscatter transmission using an antenna array.

Recent efforts leverage the DNN-based encoder-decoder framework to exploit correlations within the CSI matrix for better CSI compression. However, existing works have not fully exploited the unique features of CSI, resulting in an unsatisfactory performance under high compression ratios and sensitivity to multipath effects. Instead of treating CSI as common 2D matrices like images, we reveal the intrinsic stripe-based correlation across the CSI matrix. Driven by this insight, we propose CSI-StripeFormer, a stripe-aware encoder-decoder framework to exploit the unique stripe feature for better CSI compression. We design a lightweight encoder with asymmetric convolution kernels to capture various shape features.

The majority of the devices are related to health care and fitness. It is embarrassing that users easily lose interest in these devices, and thus fail to improve health condition. Recently, the “be healthy and be rewarded” programs are gaining popularity in health insurance market. The insurance companies give financial rewards to its policyholders who take the initiative to keep healthy. It provides the policyholders with incentives to lead a healthier lifestyle and the insurer can also benefit from less medical claims. Unfortunately, there are hardly any studies discussing how to design the incentive mechanism in this new emerging health promotion program. Improper design would not change policyholders’ unhealthy behavior and the insurer cannot benefit from it. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for this health promotion program. We model it as …</p></p><div class="article-action"><p><a href=" /files/2023-08-04.pdf ">PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class="list__item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="https://huangqy89.github.io/cn-2024/_images/logo.png" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://huangqy89.github.io/publication/2023-11-12" rel="permalink">RIScan: RIS-aided Multi-user Indoor Localization Using COTS Wi-Fi </a></h3><p>Published in <i>Sensys'23: Proceedings of the 21st ACM Conference on Embedded Networked Sensor Systems, 2023</i>, 2023</p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Multi-user indoor localization is considered to be one of the most useful wireless applications. Low latency and high robustness to dynamic interference from surrounding people are essential requirements for multi-user localization. However, state-of-the-art (SOTA) indoor localization systems cannot satisfy both requirements at the same time. In this paper, we propose RIScan, a Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-aided localization system that can achieve both low latency and high reliability. We leverage RIS to perform Wi-Fi beam scanning so all clients can figure out their direction in a single scan. However, compared with traditional AP-based systems, the introduction of RIS creates a more complicated signal superposition at the receiver, preventing clients from directly obtaining target beams for direction derivation and localization. To overcome this challenge, we fully utilize the reconfigurability of RIS to …</p></p><div class="article-action"><p><a href=" /files/2023-11-12.pdf ">PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class="list__item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="https://huangqy89.github.io/cn-2024/_images/logo.png" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://huangqy89.github.io/publication/2023-12-28" rel="permalink">Spectrum Sensing Everywhere: Wide-Band Spectrum Sensing With Low-Cost UWB Nodes </a></h3><p>Published in <i>IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2023</i>, 2023</p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>Spectrum sensing plays a crucial role in spectrum monitoring and management. However, due to the expensive cost of high-speed ADCs, wideband spectrum sensing is a long-standing challenge. In this paper, we present how to transform Ultra-wideband (UWB) devices into a spectrum sensor which can provide wideband spectrum monitoring at a low cost. Compared with the expensive high-speed ADCs which cost at least hundreds of dollars, a UWB device is only several dollars. As the low-cost UWB technology is not originally designed for spectrum sensing, we address the inherent limitations of low-cost devices such as limited memory, low SPI speed and low accuracy, and show how to obtain spectrum occupancy information from the noisy and spurious UWB channel impulse response. In this paper, we present, which not only can give accurate channel occupancy information, but also can precisely estimate the …</p></p><div class="article-action"><p><a href=" /files/2023-12-28.pdf ">PDF</a></p></div></article></div></div><div class="list__item"><div class="archive-item-body"><div class="article-poster"> <img src="https://huangqy89.github.io/cn-2024/_images/logo.png" alt="" /></div><article class="archive__item" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/CreativeWork"><h3 class="archive__item-title" itemprop="headline"> <a href="https://huangqy89.github.io/publication/2024-03-01" rel="permalink">Gesture Recognition Using Visible Light on Mobile Devices </a></h3><p>Published in <i>IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, 2024</i>, 2024</p><p class="archive__item-excerpt" itemprop="description"><p>In-air gesture control extends a touch screen and enables contactless interaction, thus has become a popular research direction in the past few years. Prior work has implemented this functionality based on cameras, acoustic signals, and Wi-Fi via existing hardware on commercial devices. However, these methods have low user acceptance. Solutions based on cameras and acoustic signals raise privacy concerns, while WiFi-based solutions are vulnerable to background noise. As a result, these methods are not commercialized and recent flagship smartphones have implemented in-air gesture recognition by adding extra hardware on-board, such as mmWave radar and depth camera. The question is, can we support in-air gesture control on legacy devices without any hardware modifications? To answer this question, in this work, we propose, an in-air gesture recognition system leveraging the screen and ambient light …</p></p><div class="article-action"><p><a href=" /files/2024-03-01.pdf
