The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter.

The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC).

We are thus motivated to develop the dual Deep Neural Networks (dual-DNN), which aims to i) take advantage of DNNs’ learning capability of latent features and ii) empower the DNN architecture with identification ability of universal properties. Specifically in the design of dual-DNN, we adopt one subnetwork to measure power ratings of different appliances’ operation states, and the other subnetwork to identify the running states of …","citation":"","pdfUrl":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00297","slidesUrl":""},{"link":"https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=AZAiLpkAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=AZAiLpkAAAAJ:qUcmZB5y_30C","title":"FABMon: Enabling Fast and Accurate Network Available Bandwidth Estimation","date":"2022/6/10","author":"T Jin, W Li, Q Li, Q Huang, Y Jiang, S Xia2022 IEEE/ACM 30th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS), 1-11, 2022","venue":"2022 IEEE/ACM 30th International Symposium on Quality of Service (IWQoS), 1-11, 2022","excerpt":"Characterizing the end-to-end network available bandwidth (ABW) is an important but challenging task. Although a number of ABW estimation tools have been introduced over the past two decades, applying them to the real-world networks is still difficult because of the biased results, heavy load, and long measurement time. In this paper, we propose a novel Burst Queue Recovery (BQR) model to infer the ABW. BQR first induces an instant network congestion and then observes the one-way delay (OWD) variation until the tight link recovers from the congestion. By correlating the OWDs with the queue length variation, BQR can calculate the ABW accurately. Compared to the traditional probe gap model (PGM) and probe rate model (PRM), our theoretical analysis and simulations show that BQR is more tolerant to the transient traffic burst and supports the scenarios with multiple congestible links. Based on the model …","citation":"","pdfUrl":"https://huangqy7.github.io/Paper/FABMon.pdf","slidesUrl":""},{"link":"https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=AZAiLpkAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=AZAiLpkAAAAJ:e5wmG9Sq2KIC","title":"A Low-Cost Wide Band Spectrum Sensing System with UWB.","date":"2022","author":"Z Luo, Q Huang, R Wang, H Chen, X Tao, G Chen, Q ZhangSenSys, 760-761, 2022","venue":"SenSys, 760-761, 2022","excerpt":"","citation":"","slidesUrl":""},{"link":"https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=AZAiLpkAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=AZAiLpkAAAAJ:L8Ckcad2t8MC","title":"Shared Secret Key Generation by Exploiting Inaudible Acoustic Channels","date":"2021/10/5","author":"Y Lu, F Wu, Q Huang, S Tang, L Kong, G ChenACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN) 18 (1), 1-26, 2021","venue":"ACM Transactions on Sensor Networks (TOSN) 18 (1), 1-26, 2021","excerpt":"To build a secure wireless networking system, it is essential that the cryptographic key is known only to the two (or more) communicating parties. Existing key extraction schemes put the devices into physical proximity and utilize the common inherent randomness between the devices to agree on a secret key, but they often rely on specialized hardware (e.g., the specific wireless NIC model) and have low bit rates. In this article, we seek a key extraction approach that only leverages off-the-shelf mobile devices, while achieving significantly higher key generation efficiency. The core idea of our approach is to exploit the fast varying inaudible acoustic channel as the common random source for key generation and wireless parallel communication for exchanging reconciliation information to improve the key generation rate. We have carefully studied and validated the feasibility of our approach through both theoretical …","citation":"","pdfUrl":"https://huangqy7.github.io/Paper/TOSN_Shared_Secret_Key_Generation.pdf","slidesUrl":""},{"link":"https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=AZAiLpkAAAAJ&cstart=20&pagesize=80&citation_for_view=AZAiLpkAAAAJ:Wp0gIr-vW9MC","title":"Using Smartphone and Optical Mouse to Enhance Web Interaction","date":"2021/3/22","author":"Z Wang, Y Yan, Q Huang, H Ren, Y Zhang, Z Yang2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications …, 2021","venue":"2021 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications …, 2021","excerpt":"This demo shows example applications of the MousePath system-a novel approach to leverage optical mouse to enhance the web interaction on general PCs.

MousePath consists of two major entities, the MousePath transmitter and the MousePath receiver. The MousePath transmitter is an app running on the user's smartphone. The MousePath receiver is a web script offered by the webserver and running in the web browser on the PC. MousePath works by putting the optical mouse on top of the smartphone's screen, and its transmission is then started and instantly finished without association and login frictions.
